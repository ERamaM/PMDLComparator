Supplementary material for the article ["Predictive Business Process Monitoring with
LSTM Neural Networks"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.02130) by Niek Tax, Ilya Verenich, [Marcello La Rosa](http://www.marcellolarosa.com/) and [Marlon Dumas](http://kodu.ut.ee/~dumas/).

The code provided in this repository can be readily used to perform the following predictive tasks:
* Prediction of the next type of activity to be executed in a running process instance
* Prediction of the timestamp of the next type of activity to be executed
* Prediction of the continuation of a running instance, i.e. its suffix
* Prediction of the remaining cycle time of an instance
